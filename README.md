## What is this?

This turns a cheap ESP32 board into a wireless AirPlay 2 speaker. Plug it into any
amplifier or powered speakers and it shows up on your iPhone, iPad or Mac just like a
HomePod or an AirPlay TV.

Works with **ESP32**, **ESP32-S2**, **ESP32-S3** and **ESP32-C5** chips, including the
[SqueezeAMP](https://github.com/philippe44/SqueezeAMP) (ESP32 + TAS5756) and
[Esparagus Audio Brick](https://sonocotta.com/espragus-audio-brick/) (ESP32 + TAS5825M)
boards, which have amplifiers built in.

ESP32-based boards also support **Bluetooth A2DP**, so anything that can pair with a
Bluetooth speaker can play to them when AirPlay is idle. The Esparagus Audio Brick
additionally supports **wired Ethernet** through an optional W5500 module.

**No cloud. No app. Just tap and play.**

## Quick start

The fastest route is the browser installer — no toolchain, no command line:

**[→ Install from your browser](https://rbouteiller.github.io/airplay-esp32/getting-started/flashing/)**

Building from parts instead? You need an ESP32-S3 dev board, a PCM5102A DAC and a female
pin header, roughly $10 total, and no soldering. See the
[getting started guide](https://rbouteiller.github.io/airplay-esp32/getting-started/).

Building from source:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rbouteiller/airplay-esp32
cd airplay-esp32
pio run -e esp32s3 -t upload
pio run -e esp32s3 -t uploadfs   # required — writes the web UI to SPIFFS
```

## Features

- **AirPlay 2** — appears natively in Control Center and every AirPlay-capable app
- **ALAC and AAC decoding** — live streaming (Siri, calls) and music playback
- **Multi-room** — PTP-based timing for synchronised playback
- **Bluetooth A2DP** — receive audio from phones and tablets (ESP32 boards only)
- **W5500 Ethernet** — wired networking with automatic WiFi failover
- **Web configuration** and **OTA updates** — USB is only needed for the first flash
- **48 kHz output** — optional 44.1 → 48 kHz conversion via a sinc resampler
- **Displays** — optional OLED or 320×170 colour TFT with track metadata
- **Hardware buttons** — optional play/pause, volume and track skip

Audio only, one speaker per board, and a decent WiFi signal is required.
